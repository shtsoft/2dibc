# 2dibc

The idea of this project is to provide an accessible introduction to particle creation using interior boundary conditions.
So far the project consists of notes on particle creation at point sources in two dimensions titled [Two-Dimensional Models for Particle Creation at Point Sources using IBCs](https://github.com/shtsoft/2dibc/releases/latest/download/paper.pdf) which, if you like, you can cite as [.bib-file](https://github.com/shtsoft/2dibc/releases/latest/download/paper.bib)
